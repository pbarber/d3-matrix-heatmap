This visualisation is based on [Ian YF Chang's heatmap](http://bl.ocks.org/ianyfchang/8119685) which itself was inspired by:

* [Co-occurrence Matrix](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/),
* [Trulia Trends](http://trends.truliablog.com/2011/09/house-hunter-by-day-not-so-much-after-midnight/), and
* [Selection Frame](http://bl.ocks.org/lgersman/5311083).

The legend was based upon this [Visual Cinnamon blog post](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2016/05/smooth-color-legend-d3-svg-gradient.html).
